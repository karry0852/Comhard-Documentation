<Accordion title="What exactly is a 'Ping Drop', and how can one determine if it has occurred ?">
**Ping Drop** signifies a momentary disruption in internet service. This interruption can occur for a brief period or extend for a longer duration. If ping drops occur momentarily, it may lead to auto logoff issues for cloud users. However, if the drop persists for an extended period, users may be unable to log in altogether.

To assess local internet connectivity (ping), follow these steps:

1. Press `Win+R` keys.
2. Type `CMD` and click `OK` to open Command Prompt.
3. In the Command Prompt window, type the command: `ping google.com -t`. This command displays the network connectivity of your local internet.
4. Observe the frequency and fluctuations in internet speed.

If you encounter a single **Request Time Out**, it indicates a momentary internet disruption leading to potential auto logout due to cloud service usage. Continual occurrences of **Request Time Out** suggest inadequate internet functionality.

To resolve such issues, contact your Internet Service Provider for improved internet services.
