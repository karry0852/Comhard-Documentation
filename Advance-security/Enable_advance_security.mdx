The \*\*Advance Rules \*\* feature gives you better control and protection over your cloud and portal access. You can enable advanced security, set up 2FA, restrict login by IP address, and allow access only at specific times.

Tick the checkbox **Enable advanced security for cloud and portal.**

Once enabled, you will see options for:

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** ‚Äì adds extra login verification for better protection.
- **IP Address Restriction** ‚Äì limit login access to specific trusted IP addresses only.
- **Time Restriction** ‚Äì allow login only during the selected days, hours, and time zones.

This ensures only trusted users, devices, and timings are allowed, significantly reducing the chances of unauthorized access and providing stronger security for your cloud and portal environment.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Setup

Two-Factor Authentication adds a second layer of security to your login, ensuring that even if someone knows your password, they cannot log in without the code from your authenticator app.

- **Method 1 ‚Äì Setup Immediately**

1. Click **Enable** to start 2FA Setup.
2. Click Complete 2FA Setup.
3. Enter website password to proceed.
4. Scan the QR code with an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy).
5. Enter the 6-digit code from the app to verify.
6. Once confirmed, your 2FA protection becomes active instantly.

- **Method 2 ‚Äì Setup During Login**
  1. Click **Enable** but skip setup for now.
  2. The system will ask you to configure 2FA during your next login.
  3. Follow the same (Method1)  QR code and code verification process to complete.

With 2FA enabled, your account is far more secure, preventing login from unknown devices or attackers even if your main password is compromised.

## Reset 2FA Setup

If you lose access to your old authenticator app or need to set up 2FA again, you can reset it directly during login.

### **Step 1: Confirm Reset**

- A modal will appear with the message:\
  _‚ÄúAre you sure you want to reset 2FA setup? For security, confirm your website login password to proceed.‚Äù_
- Enter your account password and click **Proceed.**

### **Step 2: Set Up New 2FA**

- Another modal will open asking you to configure your new 2FA.
- You will see a QR code and a manual setup code:
- Open your authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy).
- Either **scan the QR code** or **enter the manual code** to add your account.

### **Step 3: Verify Your Setup**

- Enter this 6-digit code in the modal and click **Proceed.**

### **Completion**

- Once verified, your 2FA is reset successfully.
- You will be redirected to the **home page.**
- From now on, your new authenticator app setup will be used for secure login.

‚úÖ This process ensures that only you can reset 2FA by confirming your password and completing setup again, keeping your account secure.

# Add IP Address Restriction

Restricting login by IP ensures that only logins from specified networks are allowed. This adds an additional security barrier by blocking unauthorized devices outside the allowed IPs.

- Go to **Allow access only for specific IP address.**
- Click **Add IP address.**
- Enter the trusted IP (e.g., `21.45.56.125`).
- Save your changes. You may add multiple IPs if needed.
- To manage them:
  - **‚úèÔ∏è Edit** to change an existing IP.
  - **üóëÔ∏è Delete** to remove an IP.

## Time Restriction

Time-based restrictions allow you to define when users can log in, adding another control layer against suspicious access attempts outside of working hours.

<iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="https://app.sharefable.com/live/demo/set-allowed-login-time-5v27tdyoaxv7bn9i" allowfullscreen />

1. Go to **Allow access only at specific time.**
2. Click**add time range** 
3. Select your preferred **days**, **time range**, and **timezone**.
4. Save the changes.
5. To update or remove, use the **‚úèÔ∏è Edit** or **üóëÔ∏è Delete** options.

This helps ensure accounts can only be accessed during your defined safe time periods, making it harder for unauthorized users to attempt logins late at night or outside business hours.
