In Tally Prime, you can define the settings for some of the configurations which are common for exporting any report from a single list of configurations. The configurations set here will be retained and displayed in the **Export** screen of masters, transactions and reports.

- Press **Alt+E** (Export) > **Configuration**.

Additionally, using the buttons in the right-button bar, you can set the **File Format**, **Folder Path** and **File Name** without pressing **C** (Configure) from the **Export** screen.
