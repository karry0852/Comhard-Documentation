<Accordion title="Hanging Problem Caused by TDL Execution">

If a user experiences hanging issues and the user's local internet connection being stable, and all Tally dump files (.dmp), temporary files (.tmp), and capsule files (.cap) have been cleaned, the cause may lie in TDL (Tally Definition Language) issues.

If the user is performing normal Tally entries without engaging in heavy workloads, the hanging issue might be attributed to a TDL-related problem, especially if multiple TDLs are loaded in Tally.

To identify the specific TDL causing the hanging issue, systematically remove TDLs one by one. Upon pinpointing the problematic TDL, it's advisable to contact the TDL developer for resolution.

<Note>

If there is any TDL issue, the hanging issue will persist in your local Tally. This can be identified by keeping the same TDL in the local Tally and observing if the problem continues.
</Note>
<Note>

Hanging issues associated with TDLs can arise due to poorly written code by the TDL developer or the presence of heavy code within the TDLs.
