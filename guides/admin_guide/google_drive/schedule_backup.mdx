## Introduction

We are excited to introduce the new Google Drive Backup feature in our customer portal. This feature allows users to schedule backups directly to their Google Drive, providing an easy and secure way to manage and store important data.

With this new functionality, users can:

**-\> Add a Schedule:** Set up a new backup schedule for their Google Drive, ensuring that their data is regularly and automatically backed up.

**-\>Update a Schedule:** Modify existing backup schedules to adjust the frequency or timing of backups according to their needs.

**-\> Delete a Schedule:** Remove previously set backup schedule when they are no longer needed.

**-\>Remove Google Drive:** Disconnect Google Drive from the backup system if desired, which will stop backups from being stored in Google Drive.
