In the User Management section, Admin Users have robust control over Instance Users. They can create new Instance Users, edit existing user details, and delete users as needed. Admin Users can view the live status of each Instance User, providing real-time insights into their activity. Additionally, they can search for users based on their email, name, or status, ensuring efficient management and quick access to specific user information. Admin Users also have the capability to log in to any Instance User's Tally account, either through HTML login or remote login, and they can force log off any user from their Tally session directly from the portal, ensuring security and control.
