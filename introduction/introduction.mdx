CoCloud is a versatile cloud-based platform designed specifically for hosting and running business accounting software such as Tally and Marg. This innovative solution allows users to access their accounting software from anywhere, at any time, and on any deviceâ€”whether it's a mobile phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop monitor. While users can open Tally on mobile and tablet devices, they are unable to perform operations; instead, they can only view the entire contents within their Tally and Marg accounts. This flexibility ensures that businesses can maintain seamless and efficient accounting operations regardless of location.
